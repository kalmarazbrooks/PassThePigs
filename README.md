# PassThePigs

Welcome to Pass The Pigs! A game where you compete with friends in an attempt to bank as many points as possible!

Pass the Pigs is a fun "dice" rolling game where the dice are cute little pigs. You roll and accumulate points and either pass, holding onto those points, or roll again, risking losing them. Once you "bank" your points you get to keep them and the first player to bank 100 points wins.

There are many ways that a pig can land, so in this Java-implemeted version, data was taken from an alternate sources that determines the rolling potential of each different way it can land. Through that, points are awarded.

This demostration allows you- the player- to go against 3 different bots with different strategies. One plays it one round at a time. Another attempts to get ahead, but still plays conseratively. The other... well let's just say... he really gambles it all to ensure he wins.

Can you beat them? Find out in Pass The Pigs!
